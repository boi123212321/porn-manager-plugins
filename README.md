# Plugins for Porn-Vault

Get Porn-Vault [here](https://github.com/boi123212321/porn-vault).

# Disclaimer
If you obtain and use plugins from this page, please note that only very basic support can be provided.
The real genius behind this code is slybot, whom I have not seen in a while.
I am maintaining AmDeX in his absence, but I literally have just weeks of JS coding under my belt.

As such, if my code deletes all your data, causes your dog to die, or if any other catastrophic failure were to result from using the plugins on this page, I offer my sincerest apologies, but I will have no way to help you.

You have been warned.

# AmDeX or AmDeX Izzy?

Use AmDeX (not Izzy) if you are using Porn-Vault versions older than 0.20.0.
Use AmDeX Izzy if you are using versions 0.20.0 and newer.

Additionally, AmDeX is only kept here for posterity, and is no longer updated.
AmDeX Izzy will be updated as I figure out how to write scrapers for new metadata.

# Installation
